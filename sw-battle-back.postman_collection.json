Using data already collected, the Rebels discovered that cargo shipments to a research station doing work on the Death Star were being sent from the Vergesso Asteroids. Raymus Antilles personally recruited Han Solo, despite Solo's reluctance, to plant a tracking device and EMP in one of the cargo containers bound for the research station./n/nThe tracking device revealed the station's location over Corulag, and then triggered the EMP and paralyzed Imperial security forces arround the station, including Imperial starships. While Captain Antilles led a team to attack the stunned defenses, a group of Rebel troopers managed to penetrate the station in RM-09 Alliance shuttles. But the Imperial defenses quickly recovered their ability to fight. Meanwhile, Rebel soldiers were delayed in the station by the Imperial infantry. They eventually managed to recover valuable data, just when the Star Destroyers began to engage the Rebel fleet. The soldiers evacuated the station in their shuttles and jumped hyperspace, the rest of the fleet behind them/n/nFrom the data collected, the team was able to confirm the name of the project—Death Star—and gain an idea of its destructive capabilities, but with no technical schematics detailed enough to reveal a weakness. Mon Mothma then instructed Leia Organa to begin intensified operations to gather relevant intelligence, and assigned Captain Antilles to her service aboard Tantive IV.\",\r\n    \"lightSide\": [\"Alliance to Restore the Republic\"],\r\n    \"darkSide\": [\"Galactic Empire\"],\r\n    \"doesLightSideWin\": true\r\n}",
